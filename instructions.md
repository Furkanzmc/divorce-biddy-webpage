# Concept

Our goal is to reduce the traditional 30-minute free consultation process and lower the overall cost of customer acquisition for divorce lawyers.

The app specializes in divorce cases by guiding users through an initial conversation where they provide all the necessary information about their situation. This information is automatically structured into a clear, lawyer-friendly document. As a response, the AI always references existing cases or the family law without making any interpretations.

The user then receives:

1. **A personalized summary** of their case in plain language.
2. **A curated list of divorce lawyers** within their province who can review their case and provide tailored support.

By streamlining intake, the app saves lawyers time, reduces repetitive consultations, and accelerates client-lawyer matching — ultimately benefiting both the client and the legal professional. Once the lawyer is contacted, our job ends. We don’t seek to provide more features or complicate things. Our goal is to be a single focused, affordable and effective solution for reducing free consultation duration.
